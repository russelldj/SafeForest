# Safe Forest
Code for the Safe Forest project, mostly focusing on semantic segmentation.

# Overview
Shell scripts should got in `scripts`.
Random stand alone utilities should go in `dev`.

# Notes
Most code should be runnable after activating `poetry shell`. The exception is `mmsegmentation` code which requires its own environment.
